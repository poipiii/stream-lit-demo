SpaceX did more than 16 orbital flights in first half of 2021 &amp; has docked with Station (much harder than docking with our own ship) over 20 times..@wapodavenport 16 flights is extremely unlikely. Starship payload to orbit is ~150 tons , so max of 8 to fill 1200 ton tanks of lunar Starship.Without flaps &amp; heat shield, Starship is much lighter. Lunar landing legs dont add much (1/6 gravity). May only need 1/2 full, ie 4 tanker flights..@lrocket @thesheetztweetz Yeah.@cleantechnica Important to bear in mind that production is as fast as the slowest part out of ~10,000 unique parts in a car.@thesheetztweetz SpaceX could do it if need be.@thesheetztweetz Seems like too many cooks in the kitchen.@PPathole @SpaceX What really matters for the longevity of civilization is making life multiplanetary on a sustained basis.@SciGuySpace Believe in the future.@ErcXspace @SpaceX @Erdayastronaut .@alex_avoigt !!.@ID_AA_Carmack @shivon Always loved those Empire State photos with people eating lunch out on the beam.https://t.co/T6r96fqlPG.@brian_armstrong @MarkWarner Agreed, this is not the time to pick technology winners or losers in cryptocurrency technology.

Moreover, it must be rapidly &amp; completely reusable (like an airplane). This is the only way to make life multiplanetary.Efficiencies of scale is why Starship is so large..@BBCAmos @NASASpaceflight Ok.@WholeMarsBlog @NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Higher structural margins overall are needed for reuse, plus:Booster- Grid fins for aero control- Boostback &amp; landing propellant tanks- Protecting engines from entry loadsShip- Body flaps for aero control- Deorbit &amp; landing propellant tanks- Heat shield.@Astro_Elliott @NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Inevitably.@NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Over time, we might get orbital payload up to ~150 tons with full reusabity. If Starship then launched as an expendable, payload would be ~250 tons.

Short answer  yes..@PPathole Mars looks amazing.@Erdayastronaut @ErcXspace We stole the idea from Karate Kid.@flcnhvy Pitch control requires more force than yaw &amp; much more force than roll. Also, grid fins closer to or in the wake of the booster are less effective.

This is obviously not real competition..@torybruno Your company said the exact opposite in 2014 when it got a sole-source, uncompeted $11B DoD launch contract. https://t.co/Abd5sWhZDtIn any event, expendable rockets are as relevant to the future as expendable aircraft. Rapidly reusable rockets are all that matter..@SciGuySpace True.@thesheetztweetz Will look pretty wild with a ship on top.Super Heavy on road &amp; 7th Tower segment added https://t.co/SJIHA3BLhL.@Astro_Elliott @LifeboatHQ Once you have rapidly reusable rockets of sufficient size to carry &gt;100 tons of payload, it is not clear that cost per ton to orbit/moon/Mars improves with a larger rocket. Aircraft, for example, have moved away from 747/A380 to 777, which has ~100 tons of payload..@_TomCross_ Million tons to Mars requires R R R.Super Heavy moves tomorrow https://t.co/qHG1SYO46S.@LifeboatHQ Doubling diameter increases mass 4X, but difficulty of simultaneously building &amp; launching rocket of that size is &gt;&gt;4X. In retrospect, &lt;9m diameter for Starship might have been wise. Current size is ~5200 ton stack mass &amp; ~7500 ton-F thrust, which is more than double Saturn V..Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,Baby Doge.@KerbalSpaceP What are we doing wrong at SpaceX?

I encourage people to visit and see for themselves..@Erdayastronaut Impressive.@AstroKevin_133 @torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz Then why were taxpayers forced to overpay for ULA?.@torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz Now, this sort of nonsense happens all the time with government contracts &amp; everyone knows it. However, in this case, it is money diverted from making life multiplanetary, which is the goal of SpaceX, vs the ULA goal of maximizing dividends to Lockheed &amp; Boeing.Not ok..@dogeofficialceo @torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz Yeah, but dogz rl.@torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz ULA would be dead as a doornail without the two launch provider DoD requirement. If this is not true, then you wont have a problem removing it.Your parent company, Lockheed, darkened the skies with lobbyists to ensure F-35 was single source. Seems a little inconsistent .@WholeMarsBlog Yeah.@thesheetztweetz Work needed between flights is less &amp; less, as shown by shortening time between reflights. Required work between flights for Starship &amp; Super Heavy is zero..@EZebroni @WholeMarsBlog You should notice several other improvements.Rapidly Reusable Rockets, R R R .@Erdayastronaut Weve already done a lot of iteration on ship. For rapid reusability, booster must return to launchpad, so inert mass impacts ascent, boostback &amp; landing burns. Triple whammy. Also, booster flight rate is ~5X that of ship, so multiple mass $ cost by 5..@RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut First one to fly will, so Booster 4. Booster 3 will be used for ground tests. Were changing much of design from 3 to 4. Booster 3 was very hard to build. Expect especially rapid evolution in first ~10 boosters &amp; first ~30 ships..@Erdayastronaut Great shot! Btw, Starship Super Heavy will not have an entry burn. Delta-v is shifted more to the ship, so booster entry Q &amp; heating is lower..@PPathole @Tesla @SpaceX Basic MRI is easier than it sounds good tbh.

That said, I think we can stack an orbital ship on an orbital booster in July..@torybruno @Dynetics When do the engines arrive? .@SpaceX Unfortunately, launch is called off for today, as an aircraft entered the keep out zone, which is unreasonably gigantic.

We have to keep some secrets! We have a few ideas for increasing torque &amp; max rpm even further for new Roadster. Definitely fun &amp; exciting engineering ahead!.@ajtourville Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel). Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration..@ajtourville Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load.

Now that we have lots of operational data, Tesla can unlock higher capabilities for free via software update next month. Depending on production date, power increase power may be &gt;50% at 30C ambient temp..Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts..Starting next week, Tesla Solar Panels &amp; Solar Roof will only be sold as an integrated product *with* Tesla Powerwall battery.@wintonARK Did you buy a Powerwall?

It might even be orbit-capable if we are lucky..Please consider moving to Starbase or greater Brownsville/South Padre area in Texas &amp; encourage friends to do so! SpaceXs hiring needs for engineers, technicians, builders &amp; essential support personnel of all kinds are growing rapidly..@CodingMark @Adamklotz_ @SpaceX More like V10.0.@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX Next major technology rev is at SN20. Those ships will be orbit-capable with heat shield &amp; stage separation system. Ascent success probability is high.However, SN20+ vehicles will probably need many flight attempts to survive Mach 25 entry heating &amp; land intact..@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX SN15 rolls to launch pad in a few days. It has hundreds of design improvements across structures, avionics/software &amp; engine. Hopefully, one of those improvements covers this problem. If not, then retrofit will add a few more days..@SpaceX Looks like engine 2 had issues on ascent &amp; didnt reach operating chamber pressure during landing burn, but, in theory, it wasnt needed.
